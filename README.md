# Get started with Daprâ€™s Service Invocation building block

https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/quickstarts/serviceinvocation-quickstart/

**Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime)** is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.

Below, I'll guide you through the process of setting up a basic Dapr application with two services: a **client service** that invokes another service, and a **server service** that responds to the client's request

This example assumes you have Dapr installed and running on your machine

If you haven't installed Dapr yet, please refer to the official Dapr documentation for installation instructions
